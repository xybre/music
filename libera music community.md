# The Libera Music Community

There has always been a massive overlap between those who make music and the free open source community.

Some use technology by necessity to compose, record, and distribute music.
Others use technology itself as the instrument from hardware synthesizers to software DAWs.

No matter if you're curious about guitar tabs or want to gush about the latest softsynth, there is a place for you on IRC.

# The #music Channels

- #music : The landing page where many new people will end up first, it is a welcoming and inclusive place for all music lovers.

# General Guidelines

- Be excellent to each other.
- No trolling, baiting, slurs, incitement, nor attacks.
- No out-of-context links or egregious self-promotion (except for in #music-playlist).

# How to Ask

You don't need permission to ask a question, just ask!

If you have a question about which piece of software or gear to buy, it helps if you can tell us about how you intend to use it.

Some questions might take a little while to be answered and not everyone is in the same timezone, so check back later!

- Questions about software (open source and not) and hardware (open source and not) are welcome.
- Any kind of gear, including computers and support hardware and systems are welcome to discuss.
- If you have a piece of music you wish to solicit feedback on, please describe your process and what aspects you would like help with, and then post a link, please direct self-promotion to #music-playlist.
