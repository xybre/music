# The Libera Music Community

There has always been a massive overlap between those who listen to, make, or play music and the free open source community.

Some use technology by necessity to compose, record, and distribute music.
Others use technology itself as the instrument from hardware synthesizers to software DAWs.

No matter if you're curious about guitar tabs or want to gush about the latest softsynth, there is a place for you on IRC.

Serving the Libera community since 2021!

# The #music Channels

- #music : The landing page where many new people will end up first, it is a welcoming and inclusive place for all music lovers.
- #music-makers : For people who are interested in the process of making, recording, and performing music, both pros and novices.
- #music-theory : If you prefer to focus not just on making music but the nitty gritty of how music can be analyzed or how studied harmonic relationships can be used to make new music, this might be the place for you.
- #music-playlist : Post your current playlists here! Recommendations, works in progress, streams, and music related podcasts! Your tracks will be added to the mega playlist.

- #bass : 

\* Owned by the #music op and is thus under the same guidelines, but is not under the #music-* namespace.

# General Guidelines

- Be excellent to each other.
- No trolling, baiting, slurs, incitement, nor attacks.
- No out-of-context links* or egregious self-promotion (except for in #music-playlist).

If you see someone failing to be excellent to others, you don't need to intervene, but please let the ops know!

As a matter of course you must abide by Libera's Community Rules and avoid "Unwanted content and behviour": https://libera.chat/policies#community-rules-and-recommendations

\* links are perfectly fine as part of a discussion or to start a discussion, please say why you're posting a link :)

# How to Ask

You don't need permission to ask a question, just ask!

If you have a question about which piece of software or gear to buy, it helps if you can tell us about how you intend to use it.

Some questions might take a little while to be answered and not everyone is in the same timezone, so check back later!

- Questions about software (open source and not) and hardware (open source and not) are welcome.
- Any kind of gear, including computers and support hardware and systems are welcome to discuss.
- If you have a piece of music you wish to solicit feedback on, please describe your process and what aspects you would like help with, and then post a link, please direct self-promotion to #music-playlist.
