# The Music Community

There has always been a massive overlap between those who make music and the free open source community.

Some use technology by necessity to compose, record, and distribute music.
Others use technology itself as the instrument from hardware synthesizers to software DAWs.

No matter if you're curious about guitar tabs or want to gush about the latest softsynth, there is a place for you on IRC.

# The Channels

- #music : The landing page where many new people will end up first and should be a welcoming and inclusive place for all music lovers (WIP)
- #music-makers : For people who are interested in the process of making, recording, and performing music, both pros and novices
- #music-playlist : Post your current playlists here! Recommendations, works in progress, streams, and music related podcasts! Your tracks will be added to the mega playlist

# The Siblings

These channels are not under the same set of policies, YMMV.

- #music-theory : For the more narrow discussion of music theory
- ##music : For discussing all aspects of music, they are open to people posting links of all sorts

If you know of others, please let us know!

# General Guidelines

- Be excellent to each other
- No trolling, baiting, slurs, incitement, nor attacks
- No out-of-context links or egregious self-promotion (except for in #music-playlist)

# How to Ask

You don't need permission to ask a question, just ask!

If you have a question about which piece of software or gear to buy, it helps if you can tell us about how you intend to use it.

Some questions might take a little while to be answered and not everyone is in the same timezone, so check back later!

- Questions about software (open source and not) and hardware (open source and not) are welcome
- Any kind of gear, including computers and support hardware and systems are welcome to discuss
- If you have a piece of music you wish to solicit feedback on, please describe your process and what aspects you would like help with, and then post a link, please direct self-promotion to #music-playlist
